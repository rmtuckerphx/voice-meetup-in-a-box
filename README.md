# Voice Meetup-in-a-Box

Voice Meetup-in-a-Box is a resource for those that are interested in voice technology and want to run a successful meetup or group. It is a place where those that want to create or improve their community can share ideas and resources with those that want to do the same. Credit to [Bob Stolzberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bstolzberg/) for introducing me to the meetup-in-a-box concept.
